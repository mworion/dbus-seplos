The basic idea is that dbus-seplos will generate a second path only readable to
the seplos BMS and try to gather all further detailed information from the BMS
like cell voltages and offer them in dbus of a venus system. Further it will add
and change some venus UI pages to show these information.

To improve quality and usability any feedback is highly welcome! To maintain a good
transparency and professional work for my, please respect the following
recommendations how to feed back.

.. note:: Please report issues / bugs here:

          https://github.com/mworion/dbus-seplos/issues.

          And if you have feature requests discussions or for all other topics of
          interest there is a good place to start here:

          https://github.com/mworion/dbus-seplos/discussions


In case of a bug report please have a good description (maybe a screenshot if it‘s
related to GUI) and add the log file(s). Normally you just could drop the log file
(or PNG in case of a screen shot) directly to the webpage issues on GitHub. In
some cases GitHub does not accept the file format. In this case, please zip them
and drop the zipped file. This will work. If you have multiple files, please
don‘t zip them to one file! I need them separated and zipped causes more work.

If changes are made due to a feedback, new releases will have a link to the closed
issues on GitHub.
